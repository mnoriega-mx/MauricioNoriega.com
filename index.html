                    My name is Mauricio Noriega, I am currently 19 years old and I'm from
                    Monterrey,Mexico. Throughout my whole life, I have
                    been able to witness an era of massive advancement in technology, going from
                    VCR's, to the the first smartphone, and now artificial intelligence. My passion
                    for innovation and new tecnologies has always been a driving force in my life, 
                    always seeking for new oportunities for growth and learning, which has led me to
                    my current avocation: programming. Ever since I programmed for the first time using C,
                    I became fascinated by it, and I have been in constant learning since to become an elite
                    developer. In this page, you will learn about my current educational status, and 
                    I will showcase some of my best projects to this day.
